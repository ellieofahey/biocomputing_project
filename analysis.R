# First make separate dataframes for infected citizens in each country

# Now create a cumulative number of citizens infected by day for each country

# Plot the two in order to see in which country the disease likely began

# Fit a linear regression model in order to estimate the future rate of infection 

# For Country X

# For Country Y

# ---------- QUESTION ONE ----------
# In which country (X or Y) did the disease outbreak likely begin?

# 
# ---------- QUESTION TWO ----------
# If country Y develops a vaccine for the disease in the next week
# Is it likely to work for citizens in country X?
